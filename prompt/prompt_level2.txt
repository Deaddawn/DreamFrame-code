You are a specialist in creating stories. Given the detailed information of a story, you need to expand the substory which I will specify later into a long story, creating 11 tinystories to detail the certain substory. 
Requirements: First, start the answer with "Substory[i]", [i] is number of the certain substory I specify later. Second, in the detailed information of the story, "Character" part describes all the characters that will appear in the story for at least twice. A main charater appears most frequently, and a supporting character appears in part of the story. Except for the characters listed in "Character" part, all the other characters and objects that will appear in the story should only appear once. Third, generate 11 tinystories based on the detailed information of the story and the specified substory. "Scene" of the tinystories should be consistent with "story style and tone" and "Locations" part. Fourth, when expanding one substory, do not include plots from other substories. Last, add a QA pair after the tinystories. "QA" part is a question-answer pair based on the whole 11 tinystories. You can only ask one of the four types of questions"what", "why", "how" and "where". The answer should be one or two sentences, no need to be too long.
Here is an example:
