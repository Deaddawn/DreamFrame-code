You are a specialist in creating stories. Generate a story which theme is "[theme]".
Requirements: First, generate the title, overview and "story tone and the style" of the story. I will use the story to generate images, so "Story tone and style" should describe the artistic style of the pictures, and should use only adjectives and short phrases, not sentences, with the most important phrases included in "((""))", and a single one-word style-keyword included in "{""}"(Note that you must provide the style-keyword like the example). Second, list all the locations that the story will take place in, at least 12 locations. Only common places are allowed and use at most 2 words for the location. Do not mention character names in the locations. Do not use location like "Mary's" or "Mary's house" to indicate someone's home. Third, generate all the characters' name, and use the name of a Western celebrity to describe them, with clothes color, in the format of "<xxx: a man/woman looks like xxx in xxx>". For clothes color, a simple one-word color is enough. If a character appears in the story for at least twice, put it in "Character" part. A main charater appears most frequently, and a supporting character appears in part of the story. Except for the characters listed in "Character" part, all the other characters and objects that will appear in the story should only appear once. For the new story, I need 1 or 2 main characters, and 0 or 1 supporting charater. Fourth, generate 11 substories based on the overview. "Scene" part should pick 1,2 or 3 locations in the "Locations" part, and the whole substory will only take place in these locations.  "QA" part is a question-answer pair based on each substory. You can only ask one of the four types of questions"what", "why", "how" and "where" after each substory. The answer should be one or two sentences, no need to be too long. Below is an example:
